                    <p>The aim of this chapter is to share recent findings and understanding on how
information systems can be better adopted to support new ways of work and improve
productivity in public funded healthcare. The limits of transferring explicit and tacit
knowledge are discussed and moreover, the chapter elaborates barriers to the
widespread use of knowledge management tools among clinicians. The impacts of an
inter-organizational system used for remote consultation between secondary and
primary care providers are examined. Furthermore, the authors suggest that issues
related to clinical knowledge management such as the varying information and
knowledge processing needs of clinicians from various medical expertise domains
should be examined carefully when developing new clinical information systems.</p>

            <p>
            It is reasonable to expect information technology to bring benefits to healthcare
organizations just as it does to any other business. But recent studies demonstrate that
the introduction of information technology does not in itself improve employee effectiveness in healthcare (Littlejohns, Wyatt, & Garvican, 2003). Moreover, it has proved
particularly difficult to evaluate information systems in healthcare. This may involve the
“evaluation paradox”: we refuse to use a new technology until an evaluation study of
its use has proved it useful. Particularly true in the healthcare sector, this cautious
approach can be seen as a virtue, considering that hospitals fortunately were never taken
in by all the information technology hype; but on the other hand the healthcare sector
is regrettably slow in adopting even the best new practices. Although successful
adoption of inter-organizational systems in healthcare still lacks a substantial body of
research we argue that a key issue to be addressed may well be the natural logic of
information and knowledge processing in various medical areas.

            <div><p>The electronic consultation model in medical care emerged in the early 1990s, beginning
with an experiment at the internal medicine department of a hospital in southern Finland,
where referrals were returned with care instructions in cases where lab results coupled
with the information on the referral were sufficient for an accurate diagnosis. If the
specialist receiving the referral considered that the case had not been examined sufficiently, the referral would be returned with instructions as to further tests or examinations. The new model evolved naturally from this practice. The information entered on
a referral is often sufficiently comprehensive to enable remote consultation, and under
the new model about half the patients referred to the hospital could be treated at their
local health center on the basis of instructions provided by specialists through an
information network.</p></div>
            <div><p>There are many phenomena at play in shaping the practices of the healthcare sector.
Identifying and allowing for these phenomena may be the key to successful telemedicine
projects, indeed even more important than the technology itself. In the case of the new
model described above, the innovation was supported by studies in the field: over half
of all referrals in Finland and, for example, in Britain contain enough information for
making an accurate diagnosis. So why are these patients being sent to hospital if there
is already enough information for a diagnosis to be made at the health center? Convention, insecurity, financial incentives and similar factors have been cited as possible
reasons.</p></div>
            <div>
                <p>This chapter aims to share recent findings and understanding on how information
systems can be better adopted to support new ways of work and improve productivity
in public funded healthcare. The effects of an integrated electronic referral system used
for remote consultation between secondary and primary care providers is examined in a
case study of two healthcare units in southern Finland. The study demonstrates how
costly investments in videoconferencing in orthopedics yielded lesser benefits than the
cheaper investment in e-mail-type application in internal medicine. Evidently internal
medicine relies on fixed-format information, whereas orthopedics is more dependent on
direct sensory inputs and tacit knowledge (Sternberg & Hovarth, 1999). Consequently,
the natural logic of information and knowledge processing needs to be examined carefully
before investing in information technology.</p>

            <h2 class="line">Development Toward Knowledge<br>
Intensive Systems in Healthcare</h2>
            <div style="width:890px;height:5px;background-color: black;"></div>
            <div>
                <p>The information system presented in this chapter is representing information systems
of new generation. The amount and meaning of these knowledge intensive systems will
be highly expanding in the field of healthcare in the future. The progress of information
system presented here is concluded based on theoretical frameworks of information
systems in different disciplines. Phases of information system development in organizations have been dived from two to five phases by information system science
researches. Most explanatory model seems to be Friedman and Cornford’s (1989)
intensive study (Checkland & Holwell, 1998; Korpela, 1994).</p>
            
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                Friedman and Cornford argue that information system development can be seen as the
interaction of changes in the core technology with changes in applications, linked by
activities which mediate between them. These three elements are acting upon agents of
change. The agents of change are technical development, changes in applications,
market pressures and internal pressures, such as management culture (Friedman &
Cornford, 1989).</p></div>
            <div><p>After given this analysis, researchers see the history of development of the information
systems in terms of three phases, each defined by a “critical factor” that has limited the
development of computerization during that period. These phases are 1) hardware, 2)
software and 3) user relation constraints. According to Friemdan and Cornford (1989) the
first phase was approximately until the mid-1960s, the second one lasted from the mid-
1960s until the early 1980s and the third one was early in the 1980s at least until their
research was published in 1989.</p></div>
            <div><p>
                In the year 1989, Friedman and Cornford speculated that a fourth phase might be
organization environment constrain. The fourth phase could be also divided into subphases. At the first issue of developing systems is to make large-scale organizational
systems and after these problems have been solved the main concern is to build interorganizational systems. These inter-organizational systems are often customer orientated information systems (Friedman & Cornford, 1989).
                </p></div>
            <div><p>
                Not every organization is going causally through these four phases. The development
of information systems in the organization depends also on time when computerization
has started in the particular organization or on other issues such as size of organization
and ability to change organization (Checkland & Holwell, 1998; Friedman & Cornford,
1989).
                </p></div>
            <div><p>At the moment, the state of healthcare information systems resembles that found in other
fields in the early 1990s. As a rule, the field seems to be 10 years behind other areas
(Ragupathi, 1997). However, the development of healthcare information systems is not
exactly linear. Some innovations are put into use in healthcare faster than others (that
are not seen very useful in healthcare). For example, Intranet technologies have been
applied fast in healthcare organizations at least for non-medical purposes. Also (medical)
knowledge intensive solutions are implemented fast in the field of healthcare (see Figure
1) (Turunen, Forsström, & Tähkäpää, 1999). The use of knowledge intensive systems
have seen already in other fields, thus this same development is expected to happen also
in healthcare.
                </p></div>
            <div>
                <p>General development of information systems in the 1990s as well Friedman’s genuine
work is clearly concluding that healthcare information systems will develop into the
direction of customer orientated systems. This progress is in some cases passing
through organizational environment constraints. It is possible that organizational phase
is skipped over, if the particular organization is innovative, small or organic ones (cf.
Courtright, Fairhurst, & Rogers, 1989). The more organic organization is relation to its
environment the more capable it is to react the demands of customers and adapt the new
technology. Naturally, the rapid development is also helped by new Internet technology.
Because of information intensive medical work (see right side of Figure 1) these new
applications are in the healthcare strongly knowledge intensive ones. As a matter of fact,
medicine can be considered as a knowledge-based business, which in practice means that
experienced doctors use about two million pieces of information to manage their patients</p></div>

            <div><p>(Pauker, Gorry, Kassirer, & Schwartz, 1976; Smith, 1996; Wyatt, 1991). About a third of
doctors’ time is spent recording and combining information and a third of the costs of
a healthcare provider are spent on personal and professional communication (Hersch &
Lunin, 1995). Still most of the information doctors use when seeing patients is kept
unrecorded in their heads and unfortunately some of this information is out of date or
wrong. Thus the interest in applying networking media, like Internet in medical practice
has arisen from the ever greater demand of meeting the needs of patients by drawing on
the knowledge accumulated by medicine over 5,000 years.</p></div>

            <div><p>It seems that knowledge intensive inter-organizational systems are the latest result of
evolution in the field of healthcare. Healthcare organizations will adopt these kinds of
systems sooner or later. Thus, it is important to understand the use of these knowledge
intensive inter-organizational systems.</p></div>
            <h2>Managing Explicit Knowledge:<br>
Towards Optimal Allocation<br>
of Supply and Demand</h2>
            <div style="width:890px;height:5px;background-color: black;"></div>
            <div><p>The demand for healthcare services in both quantitative and qualitative terms is growing
constantly. The aging of population will cause more pressure on healthcare organizations in several countries. The demand for healthcare services is greater, almost double
among the old when comparing to average adults (Bethea & Balazs, 1997). Managing
supply and demand between the primary parties, doctors and patients, seems to be a
simple constellation of resources and requests. However, when managing supply and
demand within the public funded healthcare system, the constellation changes into
allocation of information resources of varying proficiencies and cost structures. By
tradition, the tool used for this allocation has been the referring process.</p></div>
            <div><p>The traditional referring process has its roots in the late 19th century England. There were
three medical proficiencies operating in hospitals: surgeons, doctors and pharmacists.
The third group was later called general practitioners, and before the turn of century they</p></div>
